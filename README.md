Saily is a web app designed to make tracking times for multiple clients, projects, and tasks as simple as it should be.

Create a free account and enjoy an easy and aesthetic experience where you can create time groups, start a time and include details for the client/task 
you are working on, view how much time you spent for each group and what that time involved in a neatly organized report, and also generate an AI summary 
of the report.
